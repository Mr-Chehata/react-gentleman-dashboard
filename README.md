# React Gentleman Dashboard

A sophisticated, maintainable React dashboard template built with TypeScript, PrimeReact, Redux Toolkit (RTK), and advanced React hooks. This project serves as a robust foundation for dashboard applications, featuring REST API integration, Skeleton loaders for UX, and a scalable codebase structure. It will continue to evolve with new features and adapt to the latest best practices in the React ecosystem.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for a reliable development experience.
- **PrimeReact**: Professional-grade UI components for rapid development.
- **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**: Simplified state management with RTK Query for API calls.
- **Advanced Hooks**: Utilizes `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and custom hooks for performance optimization.
- **Skeleton Loaders**: Enhances UX with loading states using PrimeReact's Skeleton component.
- **REST API Consumption**: Simulated API integration with mock data, easily adaptable to real endpoints.
- **Scalable Structure**: Organized codebase with separation of concerns for maintainability.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with PrimeReact's responsive components for cross-device compatibility.


## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and Redux

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-Chehata/react-gentleman-dashboard.git
   cd react-gentleman-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   The app will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Running the App
- The dashboard fetches mock employee and project data from `mock-data.json` via simulated API calls.
- Skeleton loaders display while data is loading (simulated with a 2-second delay).
- Use the dashboard to view employee details, projects, and summaries.


## Contributing
